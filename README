Two files so far:

Sample file to parse (datesentences.txt)

Sample parsed file (answers.txt)

Write code that will take the raw file and generate the parsed file.

The program should extract just the date info, convert it to RFC3339 format.

If just the date is found, produce something like this:
Whatever stuff was before the date|1999-12-31|whatever stuff was after the date

If just the date and time are found, produce something like this:
Whatever stuff was before the date|1999-12-31T23:59|whatever stuff was after the date.

If the date, time, and timezone were found, produce something something like this:
Whatever stuff was before the date|1999-12-31T23:59:59-0800|whatever stuff was after the date.

The dates that are in the sample file will have no dates before January 1, 1970.

If you see a string like Saturday, November 12, you can assume that
the string "Saturday" is part of the date specific and not part of the
non-date information.
